# Benefits of Currying

- **Partial Application**: Currying allows partial application of functions, where you can fix some arguments and create new functions.
- **Function Composition**: It facilitates function composition, making it easier to build complex functions from simpler ones.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Currying can help in creating higher-order functions that operate on other functions.
