The Walrus Operator is a new addition to Python 3.8 and higher. In this article, we’re going to discuss the Walrus operator and explain it with an example.

## Introduction

Walrus Operator allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression. This can be useful when you need to use a value multiple times in a loop, but don’t want to repeat the calculation.

The Walrus Operator is represented by the := syntax and can be used in a variety of contexts including while loops and if statements. The Assignment expressions allow a value to be assigned to a variable, even a variable that doesn’t exist yet, in the context of expression rather than as a stand-alone statement.
