# Access Modifiers in Python :


Various object-oriented languages like C++, Java, and Python control access modifications which are used to restrict access to the variables and methods of the class. Most programming languages have three forms of access modifiers, which are Public, Protected and Private in a class.
Python uses the ‘_’ symbol to determine the access control for a specific data member or a member function of a class. Access specifiers in Python have an important role to play in securing data from unauthorized access and in preventing it from being exploited.

## A Class in Python has three types of access modifiers:

1. Public Access Modifier
2. Protected Access Modifier
3. Private Access Modifier
