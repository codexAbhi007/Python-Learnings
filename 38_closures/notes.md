# Characteristics of Closures

* **Nested Functions**: Closures involve at least two functions, with one nested inside the other.
* **References to Enclosing Scope**: The nested function references variables from its enclosing scope.
* **State Retention**: The captured variables are retained in the closure's scope even after the outer function has completed execution.
